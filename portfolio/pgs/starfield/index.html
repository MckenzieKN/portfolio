        Problems and Solutions of Starfield: <br><br> The main problem I had with starfield was getting the letters of my name to grow and stop at a certain place. I solved this by separating each letter and making the lines that each letter needed. Then, I used the same counter for each letter and placing it in the "rectangle" that made the lines. When the counter changed, then so would the length/height of the letter.  <br><br> Another problem I had was transfering all of my java into javaScript. Many of the problems consisted with placing all of the "this." and "var" in the correct places.
