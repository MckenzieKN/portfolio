        Problems and Solutions of Lightning: <br> <br>One of the problems that I had while making lightening was trying to get the color of the background to change when the lightning color changes too. <br> The solution for this was to find where the color of the lightening changes and put the code for the background change there as well. <br> <br> Another problem was converting the Java code of the original lightning to JavaScript. I mainly struggled with getting the image of the wizard to appear in Java Script <br> The solution to this was to find the equivilants to each line of code. For the picture I figured out I had to put the image in the preload for it to work. <br> <br>
