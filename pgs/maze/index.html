        I made this maze about 2 years ago during my first year in coding. It was made on code.org which is a very simple version of javaScript.<br><br>Problems and Solutions of the Maze:  <br> <br> One of the main problems I had was trying to make the lines and when they were touched, the game would be over. The solution for this was making a reaction happen when one of the lines were touched. When touched, they'd move to a different page to end the game. <br><br>
